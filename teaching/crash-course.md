This graduate mini-course was part of an initiative of the London Mathematical Society (LMS) and took place in Oxford, during the summer activities of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/netandogra/working-seminar" target="_blank">WORKing seminar</a> in 2020. The lectures were live-streamed through Zoom to students in Oxford, Reading, and Warwick.

<h2>Schedule</h2>

1. Friday 11/09/2020, 13:30 - 15:30
2. Tuesday 15/09/2020, 13:30 -15:30
3. Friday 18/09/2020, 13:30 - 15:30 

The lectures will be given on Zoom. Let me know if you want a link and password. **Update: Recordings of the lectures are now available on the LMS YouTube channel, check the links below.**

<h2>Course description</h2>

This mini-course is part of a lecture series funded by the LMS and aimed at PhD students. It is an introduction to the relation between modular forms and cohomology ('motives') through the de Rham persective.

We will start with an introduction to some basic analytic aspects concerning modular forms and to their interpretation as sections of line bundles on modular curves. We will also explain how to algebraise this picture and how to work with the moduli stack of elliptic curves.

Our main goal is to attach certain 2-dimensional cohomology groups to Hecke eigenforms. This course will mainly deal with algebraic de Rham cohomology (which will be explained), but it can also serve to build geometric intuition to the l-adic setting, which gives rise to the famous l-adic representations attached to modular forms.

If time permits, we will also discuss the Eichler-Shimura isomorphism, periods of modular forms, and Manin's theorem on the critical values of L-functions of modular forms.

**Prerequisites**: the basics of scheme theory and sheaf cohomology (e.g. Hartshorne's chapters 2 and 3, or Liu's chapters 2, 3 and 5).

<h4>Introduction to modular forms</h4>

A wonderful introduction to modular forms is the chapter 7 of [Serre73]. For an overview of the basic theory with many applications, see [Zagier08]. The book [Lang95] contains an exposition on periods of modular forms and Manin's theorem. For a more complete discussion of modular curves and Hecke operators, [DS05] is a good modern reference.

<h4>Stacks</h4>

Although I will mention stacks, we will not use much of the general theory. For the reader wishing to know more, Vistoli's article on [FGA05] is a great introduction to fibered categories and stacks. The appendix of [Vistoli89] is the fastest introduction to Deligne-Mumford stacks I know. For a more comprehensive exposition on algebraic stacks, see [Olsson16].

<h4>Algebraic de Rham cohomology</h4>

The algebraic de Rham cohomology was first considered by Grothendieck in a letter to Atiyah [Grothendieck66]. The recent textbook [HMS17] contains an exposition on algebraic de Rham cohomology, the comparison isomorphism, and much more. For the Gauss-Manin connection, a classic reference is [KO68].

<h4>Modular curves and geometric interpretation of modular forms</h4>

A good and classic introduction is [Katz73] (see Chapter 1 and Appendix A). Authoritative sources are [DP72] and [KM85]. For modular curves as Riemann surfaces, see [DS05] cited above.
