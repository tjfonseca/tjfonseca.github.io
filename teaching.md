I am teaching a course on Hodge theory with Nils Matthes:

- [Introduction to Hodge Theory](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/matthes/Hodge21.html), Trinity term 2021, Oxford.

Teaching material (notes, videos, etc.) from some past courses:

- [A crash course on modular forms and cohomology](/teaching/crash-course/), 2020 LMS mini-course, Oxford.

- [Calculus on schemes](/teaching/calculus/), 2019 TCC course, Oxford.
